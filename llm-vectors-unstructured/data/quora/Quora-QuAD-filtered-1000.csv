How do you calculate,"One quick way to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
 S = (n/2)(a + l)
 where S is the sum of the sequence, n is the number of terms in the sequence, a is the first term, and l is the last term.
 In this case, n = 10, a = 1, and l = 10, so we can plug these values into the formula:
 S = (10/2)(1 + 10) = 55
 Therefore, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 equals 55.
